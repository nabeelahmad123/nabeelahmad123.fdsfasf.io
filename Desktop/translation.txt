Diastolic blood pressure (the second number) indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls while the heart is resting between beats. When your blood pressure is elevated your heart has to work harder than normal to pump blood through the blood vessels. This can put you at risk of heart disease and stroke, so it's important to monitor it carefully and take steps to keep your blood pressure in a healthy range.",
